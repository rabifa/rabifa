### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as paid traffic manager in a agency... yeah, I'm the guy that put those advertising in front of your screen.

At the technological college I studied Games, yes I studied how to make games, all the process and stuffs like that.

Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and codes that use JS like Node.js, React.js... but slowly of course), yeah I learned those codes at the college, but I stoped there.
