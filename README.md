### Hi there 👋

I currently work as paid traffic manager in an agency... yeah, I'm the guy that put those advertising in front of your screen.

At the technological college I studied Games, yes I studied how to make games, all the process and stuffs like that.

I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and codes that use JS like Node.js, React.js... but slowly of course), yeah I learned those codes at the college, but I stoped there.
